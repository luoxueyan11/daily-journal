# IT5007 Project: Daily Journal - XLS

## Abstract
In this project, we did a web page combining making plans and writing journals. We
practiced some of the content learned in the course to deepen our understanding. For
example, react-router is used to implement navigation bar, CSS and bootstrap are used to
beautify front-end pages, local storage is used to maintain user data.
